# Project4 - LOTR POETRY

## Project Links

- [Frontend Repo Link]
- [Backend Repo Link]
- [Netlify Link]
- [Heroku Link]

## Project Description

This website is for anyone who enjoys the poetry of the Lord of the Rings (as well as the series itself). I personally really appreciate the time and devotion Tolkien had in building this universe. Its elements and artistry is timeless. Since this website is heavily text based, I try to design it with more icons to accomodate the text. The poems will be accomodated with a background image from unsplash to illustrate the poems' contents.

The poems are found on [Tolkien Gateway's website](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Poems_in_The_Lord_of_the_Rings)

## BACKEND TECH

The backend will be deployed on Heroku using php and laravel. It will be a simple API holding data for each poem.

**Poem Schema**

- Contains user info - first and last name, email, password
- User will reference the Budget model which contains their income and how much they are willing to spend.
- User will also reference a Transaction Model which contains details of what they spend money on.

```
Poem: {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    citation: String,
    comment: String, //Some comments left by the authors
    intextref: String, //Text from book that references the poem
    recitedby: String //Character whom recited the poem/song
    image: String // a background image to accompany the poem.
}
```

## User Stories
